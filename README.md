Hello, People! My Name Is Greg, You May Also Know Me By My Wrapper Offline Name, Joe Mama, I Like Minecraft, Roblox, Cookie Run, Memes, Japanese Culture, Furries, ETC,
I Like To Make Wrapper Offline Videos With Cringe, Memes, Humour & Everything That Can Make A Man Laugh, Nowadays! I Rarely Take Requests On What Videos To Make, Mainly
Because I'm Kinda Picky When It Comes To Requests, So If You Want, Feel Free To Make As Many Requests As You Want So I Can Pick The Ones I Like The Most! I Also Desire
To Maybe Even Make A Bit Of Prophet Off Of My Wrapper Offline Videos, For Example, Movies, Spinoff Games, Merch, Etc, I Especially Want To Run A Twitter & Discord, Soon,
& Maybe Even Some Live Streams! Plus I Wish To Make Friends With Other Animators & Maybe Even Work On Other Projects With Them! Until Then! Bye!
